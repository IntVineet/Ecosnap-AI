## 🎯 How to Test Properly

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Model Detects WASTE Objects Only!

The model was trained on the **TACO Dataset** which contains real waste/trash items. It CANNOT detect general household objects.

### ✅ Objects That WILL Work:

**🟡 Plastic (Yellow Box):**
- Empty plastic water/soda bottles
- Plastic food containers
- Plastic bags
- Bottle caps

**🔵 Metal (Blue Box):**
- Empty aluminum cans (Coke, Pepsi, beer)
- Metal food cans (soup, beans)
- Aerosol cans

**🟢 Paper (Green Box):**
- Cardboard boxes
- Magazines
- Newspapers
- Paper bags

### ❌ Objects That WON'T Work:

- ❌ Your hand/body parts
- ❌ Phones, laptops, furniture
- ❌ General household items
- ❌ Fresh food (not packaged)
- ❌ Anything that isn't trash/waste

---

## 📸 Testing Protocol

### Step 1: Prepare Objects
Get these items:
1. **Plastic**: Empty water bottle 🟡
2. **Metal**: Empty soda can 🔵
3. **Paper**: Piece of cardboard 🟢

### Step 2: Setup
```bash
# Start detection
python3 quick_start.py

# Wait for message:
# "✅ Loading trained model: .../train_taco4/weights/best.pt"
# "🤖 Model: Custom TACO Model"
```

### Step 3: Test Each Object

**Test Plastic Bottle:**
1. Hold bottle **30-50cm from camera**
2. Keep **good lighting** (no shadows)
3. Look for **yellow bounding box**
4. Check label: "Plastic: 0.XX"
5. Confidence should be **>0.40**

**Test Metal Can:**
1. Hold can **30-50cm from camera**
2. Look for **blue bounding box**
3. Check label: "Metal: 0.XX"
4. Confidence should be **>0.50**

**Test Cardboard:**
1. Hold cardboard **30-50cm from camera**
2. Look for **green bounding box**
3. Check label: "Paper: 0.XX"
4. Confidence should be **>0.40**

## 📊 Expected Performance

Based on training (10 epochs):

| Category | Accuracy (mAP@50) | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Metal 🔵 | **68%** | Best performance - should detect most cans |
| Paper 🟢 | **65%** | Good performance - detects most cardboard |
| Plastic 🟡 | **45%** | Moderate - may miss some bottles |

**What This Means:**
- Some objects may not be detected (especially plastic)
- Confidence scores vary (0.25-0.99)
- Metal cans should detect most reliably
- Paper/cardboard should detect well
- Plastic bottles may need good angle/lighting

---

## 🔧 If Detection Seems Wrong

### Scenario 1: "Not detecting my plastic bottle"
**Possible causes:**
- Confidence too low (<0.25)
- Bottle too far/close
- Poor lighting
- Plastic detection only 45% accurate

**Solutions:**
- Move bottle closer (30-40cm)
- Improve lighting
- Try different bottle
- Lower confidence threshold (see below)

### Scenario 2: "Detecting my hand as plastic"
**This is NORMAL!**
- Model only knows 3 classes: plastic, metal, paper
- Will classify ANYTHING as closest match
- Hands look similar to plastic to AI

**Solution:**
- Don't put hands in camera view
- Only test with actual waste objects

### Scenario 3: "Wrong class detected"
**Check confidence score!**
- **>0.70**: Very confident (likely correct)
- **0.40-0.70**: Moderate (probably correct)
- **<0.40**: Low confidence (may be wrong)

**Solution:**
- Only trust detections with conf >0.50
- Adjust threshold if needed (see below)

---

## ⚙️ Adjusting Confidence Threshold

If you're getting too many wrong detections:

```python
# Edit camera_detection.py
# Find line ~84:
results = self.model(frame, conf=0.25, verbose=False)

# Change to higher confidence (more strict):
results = self.model(frame, conf=0.5, verbose=False)  # 50%
results = self.model(frame, conf=0.6, verbose=False)  # 60%

# Or lower (more lenient):
results = self.model(frame, conf=0.15, verbose=False)  # 15%
```

---

## 🎥 Optimal Camera Setup

### Lighting:
- ✅ Bright overhead light
- ✅ Natural daylight
- ❌ Avoid backlight (light behind object)
- ❌ Avoid shadows

### Distance:
- ❌ Too close (<20cm): Blurry
- ✅ **Optimal: 30-50cm**
- ❌ Too far (>100cm): Too small

### Object Position:
- ✅ Center of frame
- ✅ Object fully visible
- ✅ Minimal background clutter
- ❌ Don't hold with hand in frame

---

## 📈 Improving Accuracy

If you need better detection (especially for plastic):

### Option 1: Train Longer
```python
# Edit train_waste_model.py
# Change line 70:
epochs=30,  # Instead of 10
batch=8,    # Instead of 16

# Run:
python3 train_waste_model.py
```

**Expected improvement:**
- Training time: ~1.5 hours (vs 27 minutes)
- Plastic: 45% → 55-60%
- Metal: 68% → 75-80%
- Paper: 65% → 72-77%

### Option 2: Adjust Confidence
```python
# Lower threshold for more detections
conf=0.15  # Will catch more but more false positives

# Higher threshold for accuracy
conf=0.6   # Fewer detections but more accurate
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Commands

### Check if model is loaded:
```bash
python3 diagnostic_check.py
```

### Test model on images:
```bash
python3 test_model.py
```

### Verify model file:
```bash
ls -lh models/train_taco4/weights/best.pt
# Should show: ~5.9M Oct 15 07:28
```

## 🎯 Quick Test Checklist

Before reporting issues, verify:

- [ ] Running `python3 quick_start.py`
- [ ] See message: "Custom TACO Model" (not "Pre-trained")
- [ ] Testing with ACTUAL waste (bottle, can, cardboard)
- [ ] Not testing with random objects (phone, hand, etc.)
- [ ] Object is 30-50cm from camera
- [ ] Good lighting (bright, no shadows)
- [ ] Object clearly visible
- [ ] Checking confidence scores

## ✅ Your Model IS Working!

**Proof:**
- ✅ Detected plastic with 1.00 confidence on test image
- ✅ Detected paper with 0.97-0.99 confidence
- ✅ Model classes correct: plastic, metal, paper
- ✅ Model loaded: train_taco4 (latest trained)

**The model works correctly on images!**

If camera detection seems wrong:
1. **Are you testing with actual waste?** (Not random objects)
2. **Is lighting good?** (Bright, no shadows)
3. **Is object at right distance?** (30-50cm)
4. **Are you checking confidence scores?** (Should be >0.4)

---

## 🚀 Start Now!

```bash
# Run this command:
python3 quick_start.py

# Then:
# 1. Hold plastic bottle in front of camera
# 2. Look for yellow box
# 3. Check confidence score
# 4. Press 'q' to quit
```

**If it detects the bottle correctly → System working! 🎉**

**If not → Read CAMERA_DETECTION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md**
