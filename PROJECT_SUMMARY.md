## 📹 Camera Detection Features

### What You'll See:
- ✅ **Live camera feed** in a window
- ✅ **Bounding boxes** around detected objects (rectangles)
- ✅ **Object labels** with confidence scores
- ✅ **Color-coded by category**:
  - 🟨 Yellow = Plastic
  - 🟦 Blue = Metal
  - 🟩 Green = Paper
- ✅ **Performance metrics** (FPS, detection count)

### Controls:
- **Q** - Quit/Stop detection
- **S** - Save current frame
- **C** - Clear detection count

### Example Output:
```
🗑️ Waste Detection - Press Q to Quit

[Camera Feed Window]
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Model: YOLOv8n (Pre-trained)   │
│ FPS: 28.5                       │
│ Detections: 2                   │
│ Plastic: 1, Metal: 1            │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

[Object with yellow box]
Plastic: 0.87

[Object with blue box]

## 🎯 Main Purpose Achieved

### Your Goal: ✅ COMPLETED
**"Open camera, detect objects, draw squares around them, generate output"**

### What the System Does:
1. ✅ Opens your webcam camera
2. ✅ Detects waste objects in real-time
3. ✅ Draws colored squares (bounding boxes) around detected objects
4. ✅ Generates output:
   - Visual: Bounding boxes with labels on screen
   - Console: Detection statistics and summaries
   - Files: Can save frames with detections

---

## 📊 Generated Visualizations

### From Notebook Execution:
Located in `models/` directory:

1. **`workflow_dashboard.png`** - Main workflow overview
2. **`detailed_training_charts.png`** - Training metrics
3. **`workflow_statistics.png`** - Dataset statistics
4. **`ml_pipeline_dashboard.png`** - ML pipeline visualization
5. **`individual_analysis.png`** - Detailed analysis plots
6. **`taco_simulated_training_metrics.png`** - Training curves
7. **`taco_advanced_training_analysis.png`** - Overfitting analysis

### From Camera Detection:
Located in `detections/` directory:
- Saved frames with bounding boxes and labels
- Format: `detection_0001.jpg`, `detection_0002.jpg`, etc.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Camera Access (macOS)
- First run will ask for camera permissions
- Grant access in System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Camera
- May need to restart Terminal after granting permission

### Model Information
- **Currently using**: YOLOv8n pre-trained model (80+ object classes)
- **Future**: Train custom model with real TACO waste images
- Pre-trained model can detect general objects, custom model will specialize in waste

### Performance Tips
- Ensure good lighting for better detection
- Keep objects 30cm - 2m from camera
- Use plain background for clearer detection
- Adjust confidence threshold if too many/few detections

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Camera not authorized"
**Solution**: 
1. Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Camera
2. Enable camera access for Terminal or Python
3. Restart Terminal and try again

### Issue: "python: command not found"
**Solution**: Use `python3` instead of `python`

### Issue: No detections shown
**Solution**:
- Ensure objects are clearly visible
- Improve lighting
- Objects should be recognizable (bottles, cans, paper, etc.)
- Lower confidence threshold in code (default: 0.25)

### Issue: Low FPS / Slow detection
**Solution**:
- Close other applications
- Use smaller camera resolution
- Ensure good machine performance

---

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

### 1. Train Custom Model with Real Data
- Collect real waste images (plastic bottles, metal cans, paper)
- Annotate images using tools like LabelImg or Roboflow
- Replace sample data in `data/taco/`
- Re-run training cells in notebook

### 2. Improve Detection Accuracy
- Add more training data
- Increase training epochs (50-100)
- Use data augmentation
- Fine-tune hyperparameters

### 3. Add More Features
- Detection history logging
- Export results to CSV/Excel
- Web interface for remote viewing
- Alert system for specific waste types
- Waste counting and statistics

### 4. Deploy to Production
- Optimize model for faster inference
- Add multi-camera support
- Create REST API for detection service
- Build mobile app integration
